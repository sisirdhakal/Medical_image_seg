# Medical Image Segmentation of Anemic Data

## Overview

This ongoing project focuses on medical image segmentation, specifically targeting anemia detection through image analysis. Using deep learning techniques, I am committed to enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of identifying anemia-related features in eye images. As I progress, I will continuously push my learning and update this repository with new findings and methodologies.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains a variety of eye images related to anemia. You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshwardhanfartale/eyes-defy-anemia).

### Dataset Description

- **Images**: The dataset comprises high-resolution images of the eye.
- **Masks**: Corresponding masks are provided to assist in the segmentation tasks.

## Techniques Explored

In this project, I am currently exploring several state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for image segmentation:

### 1. U-Net

U-Net is a convolutional network architecture specifically designed for biomedical image segmentation. Its unique structure allows for precise localization and context awareness, making it suitable for medical applications.

### 2. Nested U-Net

Nested U-Net extends the U-Net architecture by introducing nested skip pathways. This modification enhances the network's ability to learn multi-scale features, further improving segmentation performance.

## Ongoing Learning and Exploration

This project is a work in progress. I am actively reading research papers and exploring various techniques to improve the segmentation models. Key learnings thus far include:

- The importance of data preprocessing and augmentation for improving model robustness.
- Techniques for handling class imbalance in segmentation tasks.
- Best practices in model evaluation and performance metrics specific to segmentation.

## Future Work

I plan to continually update this project with new findings and improvements. Upcoming goals include:

- Experimenting with additional architectures and techniques, such as Attention U-Net and Transformer-based models.
- Enhancing model performance through hyperparameter tuning and advanced data augmentation strategies.
- Investigating the clinical applicability of the segmentation results in real-world medical settings.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to extend my gratitude to the authors of the U-Net and Nested U-Net papers for their groundbreaking work, which serves as the foundation for this project. Their contributions significantly advance the field of medical image analysis.
